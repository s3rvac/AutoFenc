1.5.1 (2014-05-03)

- Cleanup.
- Put the sources to GitHub (https://github.com/s3rvac/AutoFenc).

1.5 (2012-03-17)

Thanks to Ingo Karkat for the updates in this version.
- Supported HTML/XML/CSS file types have been made configurable and added more
  defaults.
- Do not emit the "unrecognized charset" message when the encoding is known.

1.4 (2012-03-11)

Thanks to Ingo Karkat for the updates in this version.
- Improved the detection regexp for comments:
	- added "fileencoding" and "charset";
	- demands that there is a whitespace in front of the keyword, so that
	"daycoding" doesn't match;
	- g:autofenc_autodetect_commentexpr allows to configure the pattern
	for comment detection.
- Introduced g:autofenc_enc_blacklist to disable some encodings. For
  example, the enca tool has a tendency to detect plain text files as UTF-7.
  With the blacklist, AutoFenc can be instructed to ignore those encodings.
- The check for ASCII is set to be case-insensitive because enca reports
  this in uppercase, so the condition fails unless ignorecase is set.
- Keeps changed CWD with 'autochdir' setting by temporarily disabling it. For
  example, suppose that a user has ":lcd .." in after/ftplugin/gitcommit.vim
  and that he is in the Git root directory, not the .git subdir when composing
  a commit message. The reload of the buffer by AutoFenc (via :edit) again
  triggered the automatic change of the working dir, and therefore the
  customization was lost. The 'autochdir' setting needs to be temporarily
  disabled to avoid that.
- Added a support for plain Vim 7.0 in the shellescape() emulation from
  version 1.3.4. Otherwise, there were errors in Vim 7.0.

1.3.4 (2012-02-27)

- Don't override when the user explicitly sets file encoding with ++enc (thanks
  to Benjamin Fritz).
- Fixed TOhtml version detection (again) and made sure line continuations can
  actually be used (thanks to Benjamin Fritz and Ingo Karkat).
- Disabled the option shellslash on Windows before calling shellescape() (it
  may cause problems on Windows, thanks for the tip goes to Benjamin Fritz).

1.3.3 (2011-11-29)

Thanks to Ingo Karkat for the updates in this version.
- Fixed a problem in the TOhtml detection when, for example,
  g:loaded_2html_plugin = 'vim7.3_v6'.
- The return code of the call of an external program via system(ext_prog_cmd)
  is now checked. This prevents Vim interpreting an error message as an
  encoding.
- shellescape() is now used instead of quoting file_path manually.

1.3.2 (2011-11-24)

Thanks to Benjamin Fritz for the updates in this version.
- Fixed the detection of the version of the TOhtml plugin.

1.3.1 (2011-07-23)

Thanks to Benjamin Fritz for the updates in this version.
- Fixed the plugin behavior when reloading a file with different settings.

1.3 (2011-04-22)
Thanks to Benjamin Fritz for the updates in this version.
- Added support for HTML version 5 encoding detection.
- The script now dies gracefully in old Vims.
- 'g:autofenc_autodetect_comment_num_of_lines' renamed to
  'g:autofenc_autodetect_num_of_lines'

1.2.1 (2011-04-13)

- Fixed a typo in a variable name (this resulted in an error in some
  occasions). Thanks to Charles Lee for pointing this bug out.

1.2 (2011-03-31)

Thanks to Benjamin Fritz for the updates in this version.
- TOhtml's IANA name/Vim encoding conversion functions are now used.
- Changed BOM detection so it does not duplicate a check Vim already did by
  default (i.e. default to off if ucs-bom is in the 'fileencodings').
- Put autocmds in the AutoFenc augroup for easier handling.
- Made autocmd nested so we don't need to worry about restoring everything that
  other autocmds may set (e.g. syntax).
- Jumplist or cursor position during detection are not affected.
- The g:autofenc_autodetect_num_of_lines option is now used also in
  HTML/XML/CSS detection routines (previously only used for encoding specified
  in comments).
- Improved HTML charset line regex.
- Added an option (g:autofenc_emit_message) to emit messages about the
  detected/used encoding upon opening a file.

1.1.1 (2009-10-03)

- Fixed the comment encoding detection function (the encoding was not detected
  if there were some alphanumeric characters before the "encoding" string, like
  in "# vim:fileencoding=<encoding-name>").

1.1 (2009-08-16)

- Added three configuration possibilites to disable autodetection for specific
  files (based on file size, file type and file path). See script description
  for more info.

1.0.2 (2009-08-11)

- Fixed the XML encoding detection function.
- Minor code and documentation fixes.

1.0.1 (2009-08-02)

- Encoding autodetection is now performed only if the opened file exists (is
  stored somewhere). So, for example, the autodetection is now not performed
  when a new file is opened.
- Correctly works with .viminfo, where the last cursor position in the file is
  stored when exiting the file. In the previous version of this script, this
  information was sometimes ignored and the cursor was initially on the very
  last line in a file. If the user does not use this .viminfo feature (or he
  does not use .viminfo at all), then the cursor will be initially placed on
  the very first line.
- Fixed the implementation of the function which sets the detected
  encoding.

1.0 (2009-07-26)

- Initial release version of this script.
